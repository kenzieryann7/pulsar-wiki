# Patch 7

[Patches](patches.md)

Bosses
- Significantly reduced the impact equipment has on boss damage, making it harder to reach the damage cap.
- Increased the amount of gold dropped by bosses by 50%.

Trinkets
- Trinket fragments are obtained from destroying trinkets and are used to upgrade the tier of trinkets.
- Since the release of trinkets was delayed, trinket fragments will drop instead of a trinket for the time being. The drop rate for these fragments is extremely low, but on release, there'll be a drop bonus applied for those level 100 and over, increasing with each level gained. Drop Boost affects trinket drops.

Jewels
- Rare Jewels and above now give a bonus to gathering yield:
-- Rare: 0.2%
-- Epic: 0.7%
-- Legendary: 2%
-- Mythical: 5%
- The type of jewel multiplies the above values by the following:
-- Sapphire: x1
-- Ruby: x2
-- Emerald: x3
-- Diamond: x4

Dungeons
- Added a new rare dungeon: Haunted Cells. Requires level 50 Dungeoneering.

Jewel Slots
- The Jewel Pouch was removed, and jewel slots are now purchased in the Token Store.
- The maximum number of jewels you can equip are 5 Sapphires, 4 Rubies, 3 Emeralds and 2 Diamonds.
