# Patch 5

[Patches](patches.md)

## [Land](land.md)

- You can now purchase a plot of land. This plot can be upgraded a total of 15 times, starting from a Camp up to the maximum of a Large Empire.
- Each upgrade gives a bonus of +10 autos, +1% gold from mobs (this is a new multiplier, meaning it stacks with the gold boost and global boost) and +1% resources (uses the same multiplier as tools / gathering upgrades).
- You can send your troops on [raids](/land/raids.md). New raids are unlocked as you upgrade your land. Right now, there are raids up to level 10, and the highest rarity is epic. Of the scouted raids, there are 5 common, 2 uncommon, 1 rare, 2 epic.
- `OUTDATED` You can upgrade [Paids](/land/personnel.md), which are NPCs which aid you in land specific activities. Right now, there is the scout. The scouts level will determine the chances of scouting higher rarity raids, and the scouts rarity will increase the amount of raids scouted, along with a slight bonus to raid rarities.
- There are 3 raids that are always available. The rewards on these are fairly low. These are unlocked at land level 1, 5 and 10.
- More raids are scouted at reset (00:00). 5 raids per day are scouted which can be upgraded to a total of 10 at max rarity. `OUTDATED` Scouted raids start at a minimum of land level 3 (Village).
- Raids last from 90 minutes up to 12 hours for Mythical raids.
- Raids are always successful, and drop a range of items depending on the raid. There will be dozens of raids, dropping almost every item in the game, and will drop items that can only be obtained from raids, which will mainly be used in other content added to land in the coming months.

## Battling

- The scaling of attribute drops after 500 was improved significantly. After 500, the chances are now 1/500 + ((attribute - 500) / 5), meaning that previously, if you had 1000 attack, the base chance for the next drop was 1/1000, but is now 1/600. At 2000, the base chance was 1/2000, it is now 1/800. At 10000 it was 1/10000, and is now 1/1400.
- Reduced the rate at which mobs increase in power, and increased the number of mobs in the Desolate Lands and higher areas.

## Bosses

- You now automatically gain boss tokens when surpassing 100k boss damage, instead of having to manually unlock the ability.
- Uncommon bosses now drop 33% more gold. Rare bosses now drop 25% more gold.

## Jewelcrafting

- Increased the chances of getting a perfect craft by around 8%.
- Some of the jewels are now more likely to be of higher rarities.

## Clans

- Added an Autos Totem which gives +2% to total autos per level, which is calculated after all additions to autos (base + purchased + land + whatever else is added in future).
- Clan leaders can now set a clan tax on resources and gold. These taxes only apply to resources obtained from gathering, and gold obtained from mobs. They do not tax drops or the action bonus.
- Each member can set their own personal taxes in the clan storage section, if they want to contribute more in taxes than the clan taxes by default.
- The clan leader permission "Details" was renamed to "Settings", and this permission now gives the ability to adjust the clan tax.
- When editing the clan announcement, there is now a button to exit edit mode.
- When receiving a clan invite, a link to that clan is now shown instead of plain text.

## Misc

- Slightly increased the chances of obtaining bound credits via the action bonus.


`OUTDATED`

NOTE: Since a lot of players play purely for profit, I would advise upgrading no further than level 5. For those that intend to stick around for the long term, getting to level 10 is a good idea as this gives access to all current raids. High level, rare raids contain extremely valuable loot. Currently, the best raid is a level 10 epic raid, which has an average loot value of 10 million gold. Your land level will also tie in to all future content that is added to land. To remind everyone, if you care PURELY about getting a quick return on investment then do not upgrade past level 5. Sitting at level 3 is probably the most profitable (in terms of ROI) in the short term, however long term, upgrading to level 10 when you can afford it is a good idea. Just figured I would put a note here to avoid the extreme amounts of whining for people are purely interested in short term return on investment.
