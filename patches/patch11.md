- New Dungeon: The Treasury. Requires dungeoneering level 100, and is epic rarity. Rewards are similar to The Vault, but improved.

Items
-----
- Trinket Essence added. Used to craft trinkets.

Trinkets
--------
- Item Rarity now rolls 0.2% - 0.4%, up from 0.1% - 0.3%.
- Destroying epic trinkets and above now gives Trinket Essence.
-- Epic: 1 Trinket Essence
-- Legendary: 5 Trinket Essence
-- Mythical: 25 Trinket Essence
NOTE: Players were told to keep hold of Legendary/Mythical trinkets when they went live, but were not told to keep hold of Epics. Any Epic Trinkets you have prior to this update will not give Trinket Essence, but Legendary/Mythical will.
- You can now re-roll epic/legendary/mythical trinkets. This costs trinket essence and trinket fragments.
- You can now craft epic/legendary/mythical trinkets. This costs trinket essence and trinket fragments.
- Trinket level cap was increased depending on the trinket rarity:
-- Rare: Level 7
-- Epic: Level 8
-- Legendary: Level 9
-- Mythical: Level 10

Raids
-----
- All raids are now common by default.
- The order of raids were adjusted, and a new raid was added (Stone Merchant, dropping items from the quarrying skill). There is now 1 raid for each land level, up to level 12.
- All raids now have 3 drops by default, and the rarity determines extra drops. 4/5/6/8/10 drops total for each rarity after common.
- All raids have had their droptables changed. The small bank now starts to appear at level 10, but credit drops were added to all raids from level 6 onwards. Credit drops get more common at higher level raids.
- Each land level decreases the chances of lower level raids.
- Scout level now decreases the chances of lower level raids as well as increasing the chances of higher rarity raids.
- Scout rarity now increases the chances of higher rarity raids.

Bosses
------
- Significantly reduced the damage gained from runes/jewels/trinkets and significantly increased the damage gained from base attack to offset. This reduces the ability for gatherers with high end items but no battling skills being able to compete with high end battlers on bosses.

Chat
----
- When chat disconnects, you can now retrieve your previous message by pressing the "up" key. I have plans to re-code chat in a more stable programming language at some point, but for now, this will make things a little less annoying.

Bugs
----
- Fixed the bug that caused your attributes not to update immediately after upgrading an equipment tier. Thanks Evelyn.
