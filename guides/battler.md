# Battler Guide

by Kalesaur

## Quick guide

- Upgrade equipment and boosts.
- Move up mobs.
- Repeat.

## Premium store

- Gold > attribute/drop > exp > mastery
- Attribute vs Drop first depends on your income/xtrade
- Max each boost before moving on to the next

## Attributes

- Attack > Health/Defence > Accuracy/Dodge

## Masteries

- Gold rush >>> Damage > Damage Reduction > Accuracy/Dodge
    - (keep gold rush 100 above others)
- Once you find a clan, clanmanship should be on par with gold rush. Consult with your clan regarding donations, rushes, etc.

## Equipment ratio

Early to mid-game, keep weapons 10 levels above armor. Late game, have weapons and armor at equal levels.

If the component cost is slightly higher than the gold cost of one level, upgrade type. Otherwise upgrade level.

In other words, upgrade types to keep the costs between type/level equal.

## Trinkets

Base gold >>> gold boost > attribute boost > stats

Until you get good base golds (max on blue is +8), just use whatever trinkets you get.

## Main ways to improve income

### Simplified gold formula

> gold per action = base \* boost \* gold from mobs \%

Therefore you want to maximize `base gold`, `gold boost`, and `gold from mobs %`.

### Base gold

- Higher mobs (requires stronger stats)
    - Equipment
    - Jewels
    - Runes
    - Clan
    - Upgrade stones (health/damage)
- Trinkets

### Gold boost

- Premium store
- Trinkets
- Clan

### Gold from mobs %

This multiplier is actually pretty good once you max premium gold boost.

- Land
- Heroic pots

### Base Gold vs Gold Boost

Base gold is almost always better than gold boost. You will often have more gold boost than base gold, which means that an increase to base gold will increase your income more.

- For example, let's say I have `100 base gold`, and `200% gold boost`. That means my gold/action is `300`.
- If I increase **base gold** by `1`, then my gold/action increases to `303`.
- If I increase my **gold boost** by `1`, then my gold/action only increases to `301`.
- As you can see, base gold > gold boost.

## Misc

### Strategy

Aim for 99%+ winrate.

### Detailed gold formula

> (mob+base) \* (1 + gold boost) \* (1 + gold from mobs)

- where mob is the mob you are fighting
- base is base gold from trinkets
- gold boost is premium + trinket + clan
- gold from mobs is land + heroic

### What does battling level do?

- Each battling level gives you more hp.
- "Battling levels over 100 now contribute towards gold gains. Each level has an exponential increase, starting at 0.22% at level 101, rising to 6% at level 120, 23.6% at level 150, 100% at level 200. This is a direct modifier, multiplying gold after all other calculations." ([Update 11](patches/patch11.md))

### What is armor cap?

You can only reduce incoming damage to 20%. After that, nothing happens no matter how much more defense/armor you stack.

Armor cap exists because otherwise you'd just go all in on armor and go fight big mobs and be immortal.

You know you've hit armor cap when you upgrade armor and damage you take doesn't seemingly change. (RNG still exists)
