# Beginner's Guide

by Kalesaur

Welcome to Idle Quest RPG (IQRPG)!

This guide serves to direct new players in the right direction. This is a work in progress and more info will be gradually added.

If you want to get a good understanding of the game's mechanics/ui, please watch the [walkthrough](walkthrough.md) first.

## Quick guide

1. Choose a main skill and stick with it.
2. Get to land 3.
3. Progress and increase your income.

## Choosing your main skill

- You have 4 options to choose from. Mining, Woodcutting, Quarrying, and Battling.

| Skill | Resource |
| ----- | -------- |
| Mining | Metal|
| Woodcutting | Wood |
| Quarrying | Stone |
| Battling | Gold |

- The general consensus is that **all 4 skills are pretty equal**. You will want to only pick one skill to main, and never touch the other ones. Why?
    - You will progress and make much more gold by sticking to one skill.
    - Obviously, you should play the game however you want. Don't let anyone tell you how to have fun. Just know that you will be **SEVERELY** hindering your own and your clan's progress for every extra skill you do.
- You will buy/trade for the other resources via market.

### Crafting

**DO NOT** touch crafting. For newbies, it is a BIG WASTE of time and gold. Sell your drops and buy whatever you need from the market. I am still going to talk about drops below just to give you some more info.

- **Mining** drops gems and gem fragments. These can be crafted into jewels.
- **Woodcutting** drops alchemy ingredients. These can be crafted into potions.
- **Quarrying** drops stones. These can be crafted into runes.
- **Battling** has less drops than the other skills. It compensates by generating gold directly, and arguably scales better than the others in the long-term.

You might also want to check market prices to see which resource/drop is worth the most (`sapphires`, `tree saps`, `sandstone`, etc.). Prices fluctuate though.

> **Once again, all 4 skills are pretty balanced. Just pick one and stick to it.**

## Next steps

Now that you've picked your main skill, it's time to progress. Upgrade the following depending on your skill:

- Gathering: Tool, Gathering level
- Battling: Equipment

Please visit the [gathering guide](/guides/gatherer.md) or [battling guide](/guides/battler.md) for more info.

## Sell your drops

This is already in the [faq](../faq.md), but it is so important I will repeat it again.

- Sell your drops!
    - keys, stones, gems, ingredients, and tool/weapon/armor components.
- As a newbie you will not have much use for them. What you do need is gold to buy things you need.
- Obviously if you need the components to improve your main skill then don't sell them.

## Things you should invest in as a newbie

- Improving your income
- Land 3 at the minimum
- Some cheap jewels
- Some cheap runes especially if you are battler
- Buying 70-75 black market credits each month (since it resets monthly)
- Join a clan
- Scout rarity (scout level isn't as important as rarity)

## Things you should AVOID as a newbie

These are only worth for late-gamers. NEWBIES AVOID:

- Crafting things yourself
- Quartermaster / The Abyss / Portal
- Upgrade stones
- Heroic pots (unless you've invested into premium boosts already)
- Pushing dungeons endlessly without improving your income first. Especially because noobs should sell keys instead of using them. Once you are less noob, getting to the first few cheap dungeon level milestones might be nice to add them to your droptable.
