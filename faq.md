# FAQ

### How do I get XXX?

`market`.

### How do I make more gold?

- Sell your drops! These include keys, stones, gems, ingredients, and tool/weapon/armor components. As a newbie you will not have much use for them. Obviously if you need the components to improve your main skill then don't sell them.
- Pay IRL $$$
- X-trade in from other games.
- I won't lie to you, the early game is tough. It takes a bit of gold to make more gold. Stick to it and you'll slowly progress. It's an idle game after all. Marathon, not a sprint.

### Why is this item so expensive?

If you are patient, set up a buy order instead of immediately buying it at its selling price.

### Why can’t I equip this jewel?

You have to unlock the jewel slot. `market`>`token store`>`jewel slots`

### How do I join a clan? Why isn't anyone accepting me?

Advertise in /trade chat. Do note that clan spaces are expensive. Up your actions count and income. Don't give up!

### How do I get credits?

- `market`>`black market`. You can purchase about 75 bound credits before reaching market price. You will want to buy these each month before turning to the market. See [blackmarket](market/blackmarket.md) for more info.
- market. Current market price is about 2m gold each, give or take.
- \$$$

### How do I get more autos?

- Buying using creds `premium>autos`
- Clan
- Land

### How many autos should I buy?

Up to you. It depends on how often you refresh autos. The more autos you run each day, the faster you will progress.

Auto potions exist — but not profitable for most people.

### It says 15% component drop chance but I haven’t gotten a single drop!

Your actual drop rate is much lower (base of 1/100). A 15% component drop chance means that if you get a drop, there is a 15% chance that drop will be components.

### Best equipment ratio for battlers?

Keep equipment type equal. Early to midgame, keep weapons ~10 levels above armor. Late game, have weapons and armor at equal levels.

### How to decide whether to upgrade equipment type or level?

- If the component cost is slightly higher than the gold cost, upgrade type. Otherwise upgrade level.
- Basically, weapon 10 levels above armor, and for types just whatever to keep the costs equal-ish

### What is armor cap?

You can only reduce incoming damage to 20%. After that, nothing happens no matter how much more defense/armor you stack.

Armor cap exists because otherwise you'd just go all in on armor and go fight big mobs and be immortal.

You know you've hit armor cap when you upgrade armor and damage you take doesn't seemingly change. (RNG still exists)

### Should I "chop the spirit tree"? "quarry the sinkhole"? "mine the meteorite?”

Yes. These events have higher drop rates for tool comps and drops.

### How do I send stuff to other people?

- `Market > send items`
- Or double click on their name in chat and click “send items”.

### What are the rarities?

common ⇒ uncommon ⇒ rare ⇒ epic ⇒ legendary ⇒ mythical

### How do I get trinkets?

Trinkets are random drops. The chance to receive a trinket per action is incredibly small, so don't be dismayed if you aren't getting any. You can increase drop rate/rarities by upgrading your Treasure Hunter (`Land` > `Personnel`). See [Personnel](land/personnel.md) for more info.

### Is my trinket good?

- Battler
    - Base gold >>> gold% > attribute > stats
- Gatherer
    - Base res >>> res boost = drop > exp > double drop > mastery > rarity

Trinkets are considered mid-end game investments. So don't worry too much about them if you are new. Just equip whatever trinkets you get and replace them when you find better ones. Because trinkets takeactions to drop, consider upgrading Treasure Hunter a bit. Scout still better because it's a sure return on investment though.

### What is my power level?

The game does not tell you. But you do not need to know it. When battling, aim for 98%-99% win rate. Set it to a mob, clear your Action Tracker, and come back in a few minutes to see your win rate.

You are strong enough to clear a dungeon if you can defeat a mob of similar power level.

- For example, Mountain Dungeon mobs are power level 700. If you are able to defeat skeletal mages (powerlevel 770), you should be OK in the Mountain Dungeon.

### What does each mining/woodcutting/quarrying level do?

At certain level milestones, you unlock new possible drops. For a detailed droptable, go to the in-game tab `Gathering`, and click on each gathering type.

### What does battling level do?

- Each battling level gives you more hp.
- "Battling levels over 100 now contribute towards gold gains. Each level has an exponential increase, starting at 0.22% at level 101, rising to 6% at level 120, 23.6% at level 150, 100% at level 200. This is a direct modifier, multiplying gold after all other calculations." ([Update 11](patches/patch11.md))

### What does dungeoneering level do?

- At certain level milestones, you unlock new keys into your droptable. See the key page for more details.

### Should I make a clan?

NO. It is expensive to make a clan, and the rewards are hard without many other clanmates contributing. However, it may be worth it if

- no one is taking you in and you are impatient
- you can afford the credits and understand the cost/reward of clans

### Alchemy tells me "Essence Chance 0.20% (0.000%)". What does the second number mean and why is it red?

That is your level multiplier granted by your alchemy level.

Base 1/125000 \* Trinket Drop Chance \* Drop Boost
