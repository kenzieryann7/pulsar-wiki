# Runes

`Home` &rarr; `Runes`

> **New players** For battlers, new players should equip these as soon as possible. Keep in mind you can upgrade your runic belt to equip a second rune for less than the price of a Training Rune 4, so pretty early on you'll want two runes.
>
> For gatherers, runes would be a late-game upgrade. They are expensive and you would find less expensive bonuses with jewels or premium boosts. You should focus on premium Drop and Resource boost before Runes.
