Portal is primarily for combat players, and considered late-game content, however, gatherers can purchase a access to collect and sell drops.

## How to upgrade 

When you purchase a portal level, it can be done in one of three ways:

* Buy it with gold
* Buy it with a single resource
* Buy it with all three resources (generally the cheapest)

## Evaluating upgrade cost

Purchasing levels with all three resources is generally cheaper, but less simple than players who only do battling or a single gathering task. You need to use the market or trade with others.

As an example, level 1 purchase requires 7.5m total resources if you use the "three resources" choice. If you just do one resource, it is 8.25m.

Using 3-4 gold as a price per resource, 7.5m would only be 22.5m - 30m worth of resources, which is significantly less than the 49.5m price.
