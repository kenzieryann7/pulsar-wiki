## Boss Tokens

### Acquiring

You get boss tokens only from fighting global bosses (appearing in the right-hand column). After 100,000 total boss damage you'll start to earn tokens. You get 1 token for a miss, and multiple tokens for a hit (depending on total boss damage).

| Total Boss Damage | Boss Tokens
| ----------------- | -----------
| < 100,000 | 0 
| < 10m | 2
| 10m+ | 3 
| 50m+ | 4 
| 125m+ | 5 
| 250m+ | 6 
| 500m+ | 7 
| 1b+ | 8 

### Redeeming Tokens

| Item | Boss Tokens | Estimated Market Price | Gold per boss token
| ---- | ----------- | ---------------------- | --------------------
| Runic Leather | 5,000 | 6,000,000 gold | 1,200
| Goblin Cave Key | 200 | 500,000 gold | 2,500
| Vial of Orc Blood | 250 | 2,400,000 gold | 9,600
| Trinket Fragment | 5,000 | 4,000,000 gold | 800

> **New Players!** To get the best return on your boss tokens, you want to exchange them for items you can sell for a high gold-to-boss ratio. Using the data above, if you needed a Runic Leather, it'd be a lot more affordable for you to use tokens for Orc Blood, sell it on the market, then buy Leather off the market.
